This is just a basic version of the README that the author of the E2 simulator can augment as he/she sees fit.

Building rmr

- Call the rmr_install.sh 


# Running the sender and receiver

- Create a route generate (.rt) file that is common to both the sender and receiver and place it in $HOME/global_rmr_files/global_rmr_routes.rt
- Build the receiver in the /tests/pendulum_xapp folder by invoking build_recvr.sh. Run it using bash run_receiver
- Build the sender in the /tests/sender folder by invoking build_sender.sh. Run it using bash run_sender.
- You can see packets being exchanged.
