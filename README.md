# ONOS-CU-CP

ONOS-CU-CP is an implementation of the gNB-CU-CP as desribed in [3GPP TS 38.401](https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=3219).

ONOS-CU-CP hosts the RRC and the control plane part of the PDCP protocol of the gNB-CU for an en-gNB or a gNB. It terminates the E1 interface connected with the gNB-CU-UP, the F1-C interface connected with the gNB-DU, and the E2 interface connected with a SD-RAN controller (e.g. ONOS RIC).
