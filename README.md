# onos-cu-cp - ONOS's 5G-NR gNB-CU-CP

onos-cu-cp is an implementation of 5G-NR gNB Control Unit Control Plane (gNB-CU-CP) as desribed in [3GPP TS 38.401](https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=3219). The gNB-CU-CP is a logical node hosting the RRC and the control plane part of the PDCP protocol of the gNB-CU for an en-gNB or a gNB. The gNB-CU-CP terminates the E1 interface connected with the gNB-CU-UP and the F1-C interface connected with the gNB-DU.
